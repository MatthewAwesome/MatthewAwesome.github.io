# Greetings from Matthew Ellis! 

Hi there! Thank you for checking out the repository that contains my GitHub 
pages content! 

I've designed my site using the [Forty Theme](https://html5up.net/forty) template published by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). 

Specifically, I'm my adaptation is based off the [Forty Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme) made available by [Andrew Banchich](https://github.com/andrewbanchich). If you like what you see, 
check it out, and make sure to give credit where credit is due.
