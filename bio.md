<h3>
My Ideas span an array of disciplines including: Neuroscience, Ophthalmology, 
Neurology, Virtual Reality, Social Networking, Education, and the Arts.
</h3>

<h2>
Some questions of interest: 
</h2>

<h4>

Is it possible to combine neuroscience and virtual reality be combined to produce unprecedented advances 
in learning? 
</h4>
<h4>
Might social networking principles be adaptable such that Advances in Knowledge can be 
catalogued and discussed in real-time, similarly to how News and Events currently diffuse across social networks? 
</h4>
<h4>
Additionally, I'm am developing ophthalmic imaging technologies to facilitate the early detection 
of devasting diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
