<h2>Passionate about making the World a Better Place, One Good Idea at a time!</h2> 


My Ideas span an array of disciplines including: Neuroscience, Ophthalmology, 
Neurology, Virtual Reality, Social Networking, Education, and the Arts.


<h2>
Some questions of interest: 
</h2>



Is it possible to combine neuroscience and virtual reality be combined to produce unprecedented advances 
in learning? 

Might social networking principles be adaptable such that Advances in Knowledge can be 
catalogued and discussed in real-time, similarly to how News and Events currently diffuse across social networks? 

Additionally, I'm am developing ophthalmic imaging technologies to facilitate the early detection 
of devasting diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
