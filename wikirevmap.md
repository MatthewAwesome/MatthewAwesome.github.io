<h2>Contributions to Wikipedia mapped over space and time!</h2> 

To showcase the creative energy that lies behind much of Wikipedia, WikiRevMap provides dynamic, interactive ‘activity histories’ for all Wikipedia articles. 

Embedded in these edit histories are trends indicating how information diffuses across space and time. 

See what is trending, and where! 

WikiRevMap provides geo-temporal insight into how our collective intellectual record is evolving!
