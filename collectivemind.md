It is highly conceivable that social networking can be used to motivate interactions between parties otherwise unlikely to connect, thereby transcending societal and/or geographical borders!

Moreover, such a platform can unite forward thinkers and gets people of all ages genuinely excited about sharing and consuming knowledge, our most valuable resource!

To this end, I have prototyped a social network that combines the depth of Wikipedia with the 
aesthetic charm of Instagram. 

Check out CollectiveMind!
