IdeaSpace provides a multidimensional, immersive environment in which to explore the fabric of humanityâ€™s collective intellectual record.

Ideas vibrantly connect us over space and time, and afford us an opportunity to thrive. Ideas are brain children; conceived in mind, and nurtured by discourse, they are ever-evolving, thought-born entities!

Accordingly, IdeaSpace aims to make ideas come alive, and to fundamentally augment how humans conceptualize and interact with ideas! 

Via leveraging the collection of crowd-sourced knowledge that is Wikipedia, IdeaSpace uses structured data available through the Wikimedia API to sculpt immersive, information-rich idea-scapes that are engineered for exploration.
