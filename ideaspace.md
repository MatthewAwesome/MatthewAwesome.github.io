<h3>WHAT</h3>
IdeaSpace provides a multidimensional, immersive environment  in which to explore the fabric of humanityâ€™s collective intellectual record.
<h3>WHY</h3>
Ideas vibrantly connect us over space and time, and afford us an opportunity to thrive. Ideas are brain children; conceived in mind, and nurtured by discourse, they are ever-evolving, thought-born entities!
<h3>HOW</h3>
Accordingly, IdeaSpace aims to make ideas come alive, and to fundamentally augment how humans conceptualize and interact with ideas! 

Via leveraging the collection of crowd-sourced knowledge that is Wikipedia, IdeaSpace uses structured data available through the Wikimedia API to sculpt immersive, information-rich idea-scapes that are engineered for exploration. 
<h3>WHEN</h3>
IdeaSpace is currently in the prototype phase of development, and will be inspiring imagination via immersion (e.g. virtual reality and/or augmented reality)in the near-future
