<h2>Can ophthalmic imaging be propelled into the realm of Precision Medicine?</h2>

At USC’s [Neuroscience Graduate Program Symposium in January 2015](https://dailytrojan.com/2015/01/29/neuroscience-graduate-program-held-symposium/), I proclaimed to an audience of 100+ that I was highly motivated by the prospect of using retinal imaging to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease with unprecedented specificity. With an abundance of passionate curiosity, my talk closed with the following words: “The time is now! Is USC the place?” 

While at USC, I forged an interdisciplinary collaboration between the departments of Ophthalmology and Neurology. The goal of our innovative collaboration was to investigate the prospect of using optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease. The collaboration unfortunately lost steam upon my unforeseen departure from USC. However, roughly three years after I initially proposed the above project, a study nearly identical to what I had proposed hit the press. 

While it was not ideal that we could not see the study to completion, knowing that very similar work had been successfully conducted elsewhere afforded an inspirational beacon, and served to validate the prescient views I possessed regarding the use of ophthalmic imaging to diagnose neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, I am confident that my insights have since expanded to to occupy more precise, clinically impactful grounds.  

Ophthalmic imaging provides an advantageous perch upon which precision diagnostics can be enacted. Studies such as the one previously described (i.e. the use of OCT angiography to investigate Alzheimer’s disease) provide a necessary first step. Nonetheless, OCT angiography, and a plethora other techniques, are somewhat imprecise; they lack the needed specificity to efficaciously diagnose neurodegenerative diseases early in their progression. 

In response to this shortcoming, my mission at present is to further propel ophthalmic imaging into the realms of precision medicine. The retina is ripe with axonal, synaptic,  vascular, and metabolic biomarkers, all of which have been shown to be implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. 

Pursuantly, precision medicine requires innovation towards increasingly specific diagnostic techniques. To this end, I have developed and provisionally patented novel ophthalmic imaging techniques that allow disease-specific retinal biomarkers to be obtained with exceptional fidelity. By obtaining these disease-specific biomarkers, diseases like Alzheimer’s disease can be diagnosed earlier, and with unprecedented specificity.
