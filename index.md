  Thanks for stopping by! I'm a firm believer in making the world a better place, one good Idea at a time. To this end, the page you're currently viewing 
  is canvas upon which to display such Ideas.

## Neuroscience, Art and Learning: 

I hail from a interdiscplinary background, and my efforts span a plethora of traditionally unrelated fronts. 

For example, can multi-sensory sensory exposure to art promote changes in brain connectivity?

Also, can tools to palpably interact with knowledge be engineered to transform the learning process? We've 
electronically charted the Physical World with astounding resolution (e.g. Google Maps), why can't a similar thing be 
done for humanity's Intellectual Assets? 

Some of my projects aim to pry at the above. 

## Ophthalmic Imaging to Diagnose and Monitor Disease: 

Additionally, I'm motivated to develope technologies to change the way we 'see disease'. 

Get in touch: 

## STAY AWESOME!
